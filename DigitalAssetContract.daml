-- Example flow:
-- 1. Create UserIdentity contracts for each user with real KYC/identity attributes.
-- 2. Bank A instantiates TokenIssuance with (Party, UserIdentityCid) pairs, amounts, assetId, and issuance timestamp.
-- 3. Bank calls IssueTokens to issue DepositTokens with full identity and event logging.
-- 4. DepositTokens support event history and advanced compliance actions.

-- This structure supports:
-- - Integration with real-world identity data
-- - Event-driven history and compliance
-- - Transfer with identity reassignment
-- - Extensible event logging for regulatory or business events
